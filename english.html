<h2> What We Keep</h2>
<h3> Our first project in English was based off of the book What We Keep, by Brandon Stanton. We were required to find an item from our Past, Present, and Future, and write about them. We were then required to present a slide show about the items to our class.</h3>

In this project, we were given <a href= https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RSeDcZ5G1Q7z9sOMzi7JRiMbAhWMJC60euFPDrqRpuI/edit>Mentor Text</a> to try and resemble their writing, in order to write our own explinations of <a href=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1M9P7Wr0kTr1RHMiXeAmWA-Vz0lm9xmZNpJ8YFOSq3CU/edit> What We Keep </a>. I tried to use the same methods and pattern that the mentor text did, for example some of my mentor texts didn<span>&#39;</span>t mention the item right off of the bat, they stated it later in the story, somewhere in the body of the story rather than in the introduction paragraph. I used sensory details to describe the finer details of my items, and they can be connected with the pictures 
Mentor text isn<span>&#39;</span>t really something I<span>&#39;</span>m familiar with, so I think I learned how to write an essay using mentor text, because having something to look at for patterns and reference helped my writing process.
