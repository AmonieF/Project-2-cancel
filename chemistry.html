<h2> The Big Bang</h2>
<h3> Our First Project for Chemistry was to research the Big Bang, a create a Story Board based off of what we learned. We also had to compare two other beliefs about the beginning of the world, and see in what ways they were similar and different.</h3>

When doing this project, a lot of the materials were given to us in class, viewing and taking notes on diffrerent videos. We were then asked to pick partners, and compare the big bang with a least two other beliefs about the begginging of the world. Something I learned from this project is that the begginging of the world wasn't just a huge explosion, and that it branched out to be more than just one thing. I may be able to apply this to future studies and comparisons that we may make in future projects.
