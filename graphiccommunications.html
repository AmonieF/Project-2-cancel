<h1> Graphic Communications </h1>
<h2> Humans of DVC </h2>
<h3> In Graphic Communications, we did a project based on Brandon Stanton's Humans Of New York. In this project, we were required to interview, and take a picture of our project. The picture had to consist of a rule of composition, and later we had to present to the class.</h3>

In our Graphic Communications project, we were assigned a partner, and we had to learn more about them in an interview. I learned not only more about my partner, but also about the rules of composition. The rules of compisition consist of rules such as cropping, background simplicity, rule fo thirds, and many more. It is something I've never heard of, and something I wish I'd known sooner. I will now be able to apply those rules to any pictures I take in the future, and improve their quality, more so than I could have in the past.
