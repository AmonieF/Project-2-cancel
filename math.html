<h2> Our first Math project was creating a box, with an open animation using graphs, along with Domain and Range o9n a platform called Desmos. The domain and range were required to make lines of certain lengths, inorder to have a clean box.</h2>

  This project was very worrisome to begin with. It covered a lot of requirements, and resources I wasn't familiar with. Despite this, I was able to turn in a completed and working project. Something I learned from this project is how to apply domain and range to graphs in order to cut lines off at certain points on a graph. I think I will be able to use the concept of domain and range in the future, for other projects that require desmos.
