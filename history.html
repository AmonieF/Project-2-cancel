<h1> World History </h1>
<h2> French, Haitian, and Latin-American Revolution</h2>
<h3> So far in history this year, we've gone over several revolutions, and our first project was a DBQ essay.</h3>
<p> A DBQ is a Document Based Question, and by using several documents, and knowledge from other lessons, we were required to create an essay. I'm taking History Honors, so the requirements for my project are different  than some, those requirements being:
<ul> 
<li> 12 Documents</li>
<li> 14 Vocabulary Words</li>
<li> 6 Paragraphs </li>
</ul>
</p>

At the beginning of this project, I was fine, and understanding the content. It was when we stated writing, that things went downhill. I wasn't sure how the teacher wanted the paragraphs to look, or what she was expecting, which led to a lot of overthinking about the project. Once I had finally decided to step into office hours for extra help, I was able to write a paragraph. Though the document was completed late, I was able to turn in work I was happy with, and work that I thought was up to standard. I think I'll be able to apply this to future projects, as there will be more DBQ's to write. I also think I'll be able to use the format in writing for other classes when necessary.
